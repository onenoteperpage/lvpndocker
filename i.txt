Create me a new shell script, that will do the following:

1. update all packages no cache with alpine linux
2. install git
3. create /app directory
4. clone https://github.com/repasscloud/lvpnportal.git into the app directory (structure will be /app/lvpnportal)
5. create folder /app/caddy
6. create this file /app/caddy/Caddyfile
7. put this content into /app/caddy/Caddyfile:
http://uat-portal.lunavpn.co {
    redir https://uat-portal.lunavpn.co{uri}
}

https://uat-portal.lunavpn.co {
    reverse_proxy lvpnportal:80
    tls danijel@repasscloud.com
}
8. test if exists docker-compose.yml file, if it does exist, delete
9. create docker-compose file like this (update as required):
version: '3.8'

services:
  lvpnportal:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: lvpnportal:dev
    container_name: lvpnportal
    restart: always
    expose:
      - "80"
    networks:
      - lvpn_network

  caddy:
    image: caddy:latest
    depends_on:
      - lvpnportal
    container_name: caddy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    networks:
      - lvpn_network
    volumes:
      - ./etc/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile

networks:
  lvpn_network:
    driver: bridge
